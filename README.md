# Bingo

This plugin was all developed by me with the exception of the following parts: 
- SchematicManager
- quests.EntityHead and their use to assign Ids to player skulls 
- Consumed APIs.

 
Credits for SchematicManager, quests.EntityHead and their use go to [APJifengc](https://github.com/APJifengc/Bingo).

This project has been in development since June 2023 for Minecraft Version 1.20.1.

## What is Bingo?
This project is actually a Lockout mini game with kits. Each kit contains a series of items and special abilities that receive a buff throughout the game.

Matches can be free for all or in two teams. If you choose the team mode, you can still choose between random teams or choose teams manually. It is possible to choose between kit and non-kit matches. And finally, for matches with Teams, it is possible to choose between the possibility of playing Casual or Ranked matches.

## How to play?
Create a match any way you like. If it's a game with Kits enabled, all players must choose a Kit. The first team to complete 13 tasks wins. If it's free for all, the game ends when all tasks are completed and the player with the most points wins.

Throughout the game, 3 mini feasts and 1 feast spawn at random map coordinates. They contain useful loot for the match. When the match ends, the map is deleted and everyone is teleported back to the spawn (Each match has a unique map).
